# Monad Velocity - Unleash Blockchain Gameplay on Monad

## Project Overview

**Monad Velocity** is a high-octane, multiplayer car racing game built on the cutting-edge Monad blockchain. Leveraging Monad's exceptional throughput and low latency, we deliver a seamless and engaging real-time racing experience where players can own, trade, and compete with unique, blockchain-based assets.

This project aims to showcase the power of Monad for interactive, on-chain games, demonstrating innovative gameplay mechanics powered by NFTs and transparent, immutable records.

## Key Features

* **Multiplayer Racing:** Engage in thrilling real-time races against other players.
* **NFT Car Ownership:** Each car is a unique NFT on the Monad blockchain, allowing for true digital ownership.
* **Customizable Cars:** Personalize your vehicles with NFT-based upgrades, skins, and accessories.
* **On-Chain Race Results & Leaderboards:** Race outcomes and player rankings are recorded transparently and immutably on the Monad blockchain.
* **Potential for Player-Owned Tracks/Events:** Future iterations could explore player-owned tracks and community-driven racing events as NFTs.
* **In-Game Token Economy:** A Monad-based in-game currency for rewards, upgrades, and participation.

## Tech Stack

* **Blockchain:** Monad
* **Smart Contracts:** Solidity
* **Game Engine (Client-Side - Web-Based):** Three.js (for 3D graphics)
* **Networking (Multiplayer - Web-Based):** WebSockets, Socket.IO
* **Frontend (Web3 Integration):** JavaScript (React), Web3.js or Ethers.js
* **Backend (Game Server):** Node.js (Express.js)
* **Database:** FireBase
* **Asset Management:** IPFS (InterPlanetary File System)

## Getting Started (Development)

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    * Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed.
    * A Monad development environment set up (refer to Monad's official documentation).
    * Metamask or a compatible Web3 wallet.

2.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [YOUR_REPOSITORY_URL]
    cd monad-velocity
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies (Frontend):**
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```

4.  **Install Dependencies (Backend):**
    ```bash
    cd backend
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```

5.  **Smart Contract Deployment:**
    * Navigate to the `contracts` directory.
    * Compile and deploy the Solidity smart contracts to the Monad testnet (or local Monad node) using a deployment script (e.g., using Hardhat or Foundry).
    * Update the contract addresses in the frontend and backend configurations.

6.  **Backend Configuration:**
    * Configure the database connection and other backend settings in the `.env` file or configuration files.

7.  **Run the Backend Server:**
    ```bash
    cd backend
    npm run dev
    # or
    yarn dev
    ```

8.  **Run the Frontend Application:**
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    npm start
    # or
    yarn start
    ```

9.  **Connect with Your Wallet:**
    * Open the frontend application in your browser.
    * Connect your Web3 wallet (e.g., Metamask) to interact with the Monad blockchain.
